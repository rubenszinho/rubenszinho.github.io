    <h2>About Me</h2>
    Hi, I'm Samuel Rubens, a dedicated computer engineering student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). My passion lies in the intersection between electrical/electronic engineering and computer science. I have developed expertise in designing and developing personal computers, large-scale systems, embedded systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

    As a skilled software developer, I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages, including <strong>C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Dart, and Java</strong>. I have experience with various frameworks and technologies, such as <strong>React, NextJS, NodeJS, Rust</strong>, and embedded systems. I'm also well-versed in Git and hold a <strong>Cambridge Advanced Exam (CAE)</strong> certification, showcasing my proficiency in English.

    Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on several projects, such as:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Zenith Aerospace (Mar 2021 - Oct 2021):</strong> I worked on the development of the Zenith Monitor app, focusing on aesthetic structuring (front-end), testing infrastructure (CI), and app linter. Additionally, I managed and developed projects in the Linux drivers sector, where I improved communication processes between sensors and the Linux kernel.</li>
        <li><strong>U-GET (Oct 2021 - Jun 2022):</strong> As a full-stack developer intern, I contributed to the development of the company's MVC in Rust, led a single-page application (SPA) project in TypeScript, and collaborated on the aesthetic structuring of apps using Figma, as well as testing and CI/CD.</li>
        <li><strong>BTG Pactual (Jul 2022 - Present):</strong> As a mobile developer intern, I have been working on the BTGTRADER app, developed an automation and integration tool for Azure DevOps and Monday, and participated in the development of Widget and Unit tests. I also improved the app's accessibility and implemented a Windows-compatible version of the app.</li>
    </ol>

    In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge with others.
